Other devices to be added in a future update

When checkm8 and/or Futurerestore allow for downgrades on blackbird vulerable devices (bypassing SEP and with working Baseband Support on iPhones. iPod's and iPad's don't have a baseband unless they're cellular) them firmwares will be added for supported devices
